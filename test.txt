API (or functionality to exposed)

-> So basically a news bulletin serves the purpose of displaying top news to users.to hum pages pe news dikhayenge user can click to read further
comments? Yes fine 
so ek end point to get all news stored in DB
ek endpoint to add a new news - this i want to question..!!
ek endpoint jaha pe delete kar sakte hai
Now the question is ?
  1)  Should the fiteration criteria be part of back-end or should be managed by front-end ? front end would be fast and better..u fetch all data and render the required data (Cool)
  2)  I want to question the adding end point ..why would user be allowed to add news? Yes true (IN TERMS OF USER NO USE)
  3)  Notification pop-up should be designed for newer updates ? iska bata ..ye kise soch rha hi (for this login must be             
      associated ). The last left time disconnect time must be tracked and newer news added after that must be shown.
      okay 
      or another way is after a given interval just broadcast all news 15 minutes later to current time who all are connected.
      (here no need to maintain login) (just show less than 3-4 news)??(inputs) Complex hai ye mujhe bhi nahi pata how to do?
      But implementing a notication box is cool ? (Comments: True just the tracking part is difficult to think)
   4)Sorting functionality(extra feature)
   5) Fiteration option ( Yes cool )
       -> Filteration options ?
       like if the want to see news of specific publisher only or of specific domain..(domain not possible in this case but publiser) Thik hai 
   6) Should login be maintainedor not ? yes but we will work first on base end points then can add login and expose end points to logged in users only (okay cool)
   
   lets try to wrap now.. Okay I am feeling sleepy too 
   Kal karte hai
       bc wrap to start coding..soyega kya
       haa yaar bahut thak gaya hu 
       
   okay sun mi ek basic app structure taiyaar rkhunga express app kaa fir hum routers divide kr lenge tu ek route pe kaam krna mi dusre pe?? cool 
   chal fir goodnight 
 But filteration is mentioned right ?yes read and filter ((oka)y)


mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds123562.mlab.com:23562/userinfo


so uptill now the endpoints that are confirmed are 
1) get all news - localhost:3000/news
2) get news according to sorting criteria localhost:3000/news/sort
3) get filtered news localhost:3000/news/:publishername
4)
